When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository can be used when a project requires collaboration from other team mates.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It is possible that newly introduced commit may cause a bug in the local repository of a user; so it is better that the user should be allowed to pull request whenever they want.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are used for directly copying repository to the gtihub account; clone is used for
copying repository to local machine and branches are used for making a new hierarchy of
commits for experimental purposes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that differnces can be analyzed between two versions, even at the time
when there is no internet connectivity.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/Github, other CVS like google sheets could be used. Google sheets make
synchronization tasks easier but then it robs user of flexibility, which is very
much required.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When the project dwells into experimental modifications, that's when a separate branch is
needed. Separate branch makes it easy to incorporate any changes wihout affecting the main branch. However, this appoach takes a lot of time.
